\section{Dynamic Analysis}

-> test with simple bycycle, show behavior, try to see the counter steer thing ?\\ (counter steering to innitiate leaning moment, less control action)

-> how does it behave on straight road ( with bump and or not flat) ?\\

-> how does it behave during cornering (road with bump and not flat)

-> relationship spring to negate effect of weight and weight change ?\\

\subsection{Energy efficiency}
TODO IF TIME : 
we can if we have time use the markov process and integrate of the efficiency over many trips to have an average trip efficiency and have some weight.

also get some number on the acceleration braking amount and quantity (how much and how many) (use markov model (1 seconde per state and compare with gofar data for braking)

\subsection{Travel time}
It's also interesting to look at the speed profile on road to define how fast the vehicle need to go (as required by real world data) and the tradeoff between trip time and speed if we have to cap the max speed (at let's say 60 kmh). (effect should be manageable since little time is spent at autobahn speed.

get a number on the impact of the vehicle performance on trip duration.
