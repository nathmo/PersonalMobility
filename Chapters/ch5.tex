\section{Dynamic Stability Analysis}

-> test with simple bycycle, show behavior, try to see the counter steer thing ?\\

-> how does it behave on straight road ( with bump and or not flat) ?\\

-> how does it behave during cornering (road with bump and not flat)

-> relationship spring to negate effect of weight and weight change ?\\
