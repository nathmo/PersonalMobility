\section{Innovative Design Concept}

\subsection{Elevating the Vehicle Without Increasing Frontal Area}

from previous chapter, want to lower frontal area while keeping user eyes high from the ground

how can we do so on a kinematic standpoint and what synergies can we gain from coupling the steering to the leaning ?\\

*** steering approach\\
-> skid steer\\
-> ackerman\\
-> swerve wheel + crab steering\\
-> 2 wheel lean to steer (trail + no trail ?)\\
-> other\\
*** geometry and kinematic\\
-> vertical actuator\\
-> arm along vehciule\\
-> arm sideways vehicule\\
-> others ?\\

\subsection{mass reduction}
can we afford high performance material ? do they make sense ? what material can we use to keep mass and carbon imprint low

\subsection{Benefits for Vertical Parking and Accessibility}
talk about the advantage of the selected design, how it could park vertically and what good it would do.\\

talk about the stability while boarding and exiting, how the vehciule can help to make it a "normal chair" posture then reclining\\

\subsection{Literature review of existing concept}

\subsection{Integration with Public Infrastructure (e.g., Trains)}
