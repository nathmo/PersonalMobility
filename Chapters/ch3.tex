\section{Design Considerations}

\subsection{Reducing Frontal Area and improving the coefficient of drag}
look at how many passengers per vehicle on average trips, the seating layout and its implication on the aerodynamics.

\subsection{Addressing Visibility and Safety Concerns in Traffic}

why trike and velomobile are no more mainsteam (economics and  driving lower than anybody else)

\subsection{User comfort requirement}
(thermal, noise, water ingress, seating position)
study about what people need in car. we are we sensitive about when travelling / commuting
\subsection{Narrow Track and Low Vehicle Geometry (literature review)}
Acknowledge existing solution
