\section{Design Considerations}

\subsection{Reducing Frontal Area and improving the coefficient of drag}
look at how many passengers per vehicle on average trips, the seating layout and its implication on the aerodynamics.

look at how to reduce frontal area by seating position

\subsection{Reducing mass and embodied energy}
why are car heavy ? what is energy intensive in a car ?

\subsection{Addressing Visibility and Safety Concerns in Traffic}

why trike and velomobile are not more mainstream (economics and  driving lower than anybody else, more ?)

\subsection{User comfort requirement}
(thermal, noise, water ingress, seating position)
study about what people need in car. we are we sensitive about when travelling / commuting

\subsection{Narrow Track and Low Vehicle Geometry (literature review)}
Acknowledge existing solution
