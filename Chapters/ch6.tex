\section{System integration}

\subsection{Trade-offs Between Design Choices}

\subsection{power, speed gravity, acceleration, braking}

from chapter 2, how much accelerating do we need ? (look at comfortable acceleration in traffic to keep it smooth at a red light for instance. also look at hill climbing what slope can be expected and at what speed\\)

how much regenerative braking ? (look at braking data, aim to recover energy in most case as full emergency braking are very rare and most braking is under 0.3g) \\

what power for the motor ? (battery asymmetry charge discharge, size for climbing up and acceleration in traffic)\\5

what battery size ? look at daily km, 99\% cutoff and previous efficiency\\
(likely 1kwh, 250 km range, 10kg)
impact on range, climbing hill, user acceptance \\

\subsection{System review}
how do we compare against other solutions ?\\
key performance indicator ? \\
