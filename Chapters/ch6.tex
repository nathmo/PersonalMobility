\section{System integration}

\subsection{Trade-offs Between Design Choices}

\subsection{power, speed gravity, acceleration, braking}

from chapter 2, how much accelerating do we need ? \\
how much regenerative braking ?  \\
what power for the motor ? \\
what battery size ?\\
impact on range, climbing hill, user acceptance \\

\subsection{System review}
how do we compare against other solutions ?\\
key performance indicator ? \\
