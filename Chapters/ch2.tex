\section{Background and Context}

\subsection{First Principles Analysis of Energy Loss in an average car}
modele with drag, rolling losses, etc as a function of speed.

\subsection{acceleration braking regime (city) and cruise regime losses}
review of the average trip made and at what speed. how many braking/acceleration per kilometer, etc.

\subsection{Importance of Mass and Aerodynamics in Energy Efficiency}
dig deeper into the main factor of losses in both regime (cruise and city)
