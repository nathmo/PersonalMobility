\subsection{Suggestions for Future Research}
a prototype should be built to verify the theoretical model.

Safety in case of collisions should be integrated

if such vehicle was deployed, how would traffic look like inside the city ? would it help with congestion ? 
impact of trip time if we remonter la file au feux ? safety impact ?

Multi-Modal Transport Efficiency with Train Onboarding, what would happen if we took the train with our ”bike++” to coverage long distance ?
