Urban environments face increasing challenges related to road traffic congestion, limited parking, and the environmental inefficiencies of personal cars. Meanwhile, current cycle-based alternatives such as e-bikes and velomobiles often fail to meet comfort, safety, or usability expectations, limiting their adoption. This project investigates the feasibility of a new vehicle category which bridges that gap: a compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient vehicle concept offering car-like comfort while retaining the legal and spatial advantages of a bicycle.

Using a first-principles approach, we model the energy demands of short-distance urban trips, accounting for both ideal and real-world driving patterns. We identify key parameters such as mass, frontal area, and drivetrain efficiency that govern energy use. We then introduce a novel vehicle design that incorporates an active leaning mechanism, vertical parking capability, and tandem seating, aiming to balance aerodynamic performance, urban compatibility, and user experience.

The vehicle concept is evaluated against existing solutions in terms of efficiency, spatial footprint, and human factors. A comparative simulation study using PyBullet explores the steady-state dynamic stability of various configurations (3-wheel vs. 4-wheel, pivot vs. linear leaning mechanisms) under PID control of the proposed design. Results demonstrate that the proposed design offers superior trade-offs in the three metric defined, albeit at the cost of increased mechanical complexity and the need for active stabilization requiring a complex controller.

This study provides both a physical and behavioral justification for a pragmatic urban mobility solution. It also outlines the path toward prototyping, with considerations for dynamic control and safety.
